The only prerequisites is pure enthusiasm towards open source contribution, anybody can register and participate in hacktober fest.

The basic knowledge of Git and Github and knowledge in any programming language line c,c++,java,python,html,etc.. would help a lot to resolve these issues.

Happy coding!!
