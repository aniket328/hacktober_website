### About Hacktober
2013 marked the begining of this amazing fest wherein all the open source enthusiasts were welcomed.
As the name suggests its a month long celebration for Oct 1 to Oct 31 every year.

## Aim 
Facilitated by DigitalOcean , it intends to urge contributors to add to open-source ventures, help each other to grow and reward the local area.

## What's there for you!!!!
Whether you are a  complete novice in the field of open source , or an experienced one.
There's something in store for everyone.
They say if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far walk together.


 - Prepare and share your project for collaboration
 - Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
 - Organize an event
 - Mentor others
 - Donate directly to open source projects


## Values

- Everyone is welcome. Participants in Hacktoberfest come from all over the world and represent thousands of unique skill sets. This program welcomes everyone who's already part of the open source software community, and anyone who is interested in “diving in”.

- Quantity is fun, quality is key. Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. However, it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source software. We are committed to prioritizing quality contributions as outlined in our participation rules.

- Short-term action, long-term impact. In the open source software community, we are standing on the shoulders of project maintainers and those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long after October.

Perks of participating in hacktoberfest

- It urges you to chip away at different undertakings and gain your insight and expirience in this. 

- You can develop your organizations through this stage which will help you in future. 

- Hacktober Fest gives you a recognization over others, which assists you with developing your vocation. 

- It rouses you to put forth a valiant effort and empower you while give invigorating treats like shirts / establishing plants of your name on finishing 4 ventures.


### Hacktober Rules 
 - Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the '**hacktoberfest**' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest
 - You can **sign up** anytime **between October 1 and October 31**. Just be sure to sign up on the official [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for your pull requests to count.
 - The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
 - If a maintainer reports your pull request as **spam**, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
 - If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be **ineligible** to participate.
 - A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the '**hacktoberfest-accepted**' label.

### About Pull Requests

**SOME TIPS**:
- Make smaller pull requests
- Write useful descriptions and titles
- Have on-point commit messages
- Add comments on your pull request to help guide the reviewer<br/>
**These tips help the reviewer so that your PR gets accepted fast**.

**Poor standards**:
- Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull
requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.
- Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's
branch/commits and making a pull request.
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a
hindrance vs. helping.
- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request
count for October.
- Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull
requests to remove a stray whitespace is not
 
 **Word of Caution**
- Spammy pull requests can be labeled as “**spam**” or "**invalid**." Pull requests with a label containing either of these words won't count toward Hacktoberfest.
- Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer. PRs can be accepted either by being merged, having an overall approving review, or having the ‘**hacktoberfest-accepted**’ label.After a PR is approved it enters a fourteen-day review window where hacktober team does some more checking in accordance with **Hacktober Rules**.After the fourteen-day window has passed, the PR becomes eligible for Hacktoberfest and this cannot be reversed.
- Bad repositories will be excluded. Many repositories encourage participants to make simple pull requests – to quickly gain a pull request towards winning. While these projects may be a valuable learning tool for new contributors, they often aren't valuable and high quality contributions to open source projects, and go against the fest's core values.

**How to make a PR**
- Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic.<br/>
  Find these repostiories.
- When a repostiory interests you. **Fork it **
  ![Hacktoberfest 2021](./images/fork.PNG)
- Copy the URL of this forked repo.
- In you PC/Laptop ,open terminal (Linux)/Command Prompt and in the designated folder run **git clone "copied URL"** This will clone the repo to your PC.
- Open repo in PC. Do necessary changes then type **git status** it will show some **untracked files** .These are changes you did but are not present in your repo at github.
- Run **git add .** to stage these changes. Now you are ready to commit.
- Run **git commit -m "Any message you want to type , It will be good if its related to the changes you did"**
- Run **git push origin main**. In place of "main" write your branch name.
