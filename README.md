 - The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

### Word of Caution
- Spammy pull requests can be labeled as “**spam**” or "**invalid**." Pull requests with a label containing either of these words won't count toward Hacktoberfest.
- Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer. PRs can be accepted either by being merged, having an overall approving review, or having the ‘**hacktoberfest-accepted**’ label.After a PR is approved it enters a fourteen-day review window where hacktober team does some more checking in accordance with **Hacktober Rules**.After the fourteen-day window has passed, the PR becomes eligible for Hacktoberfest and this cannot be reversed.
- Bad repositories will be excluded.Many repositories encourage participants to make simple pull requests – to quickly gain a pull request towards winning. While these projects may be a valuable learning tool for new contributors, they often aren't valuable and high quality contributions to open source projects, and go against the fest's core values.

## Good Luck and Warm Welcome to All
